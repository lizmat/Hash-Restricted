=head1 NAME

Hash::Restricted - trait for restricting keys in hashes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Hash::Restricted;

my %h is restricted = a => 42, b => 666;
%h<c> = 317;  # dies

my %h is restricted<a b>;
%h<a> = 42;
%h<b> = 666;
%h<c> = 317;  # dies

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hash::Restricted provides a C<is restricted> trait on C<Map>s and C<Hash>es
as an easy way to restrict which keys are going to be allowed in the C<Map> /
C<Hash>.

If you do not specify any keys with C<is restricted>, it will limit to the
keys that were specified when the C<Map> / C<Hash> was initialized.

If you B<do> specify keys, then those will be the keys that will be allowed.
