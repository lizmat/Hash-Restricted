NAME
====

Hash::Restricted - trait for restricting keys in hashes

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Hash::Restricted;

my %h is restricted = a => 42, b => 666;
%h<c> = 317;  # dies

my %h is restricted<a b>;
%h<a> = 42;
%h<b> = 666;
%h<c> = 317;  # dies
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Hash::Restricted provides a `is restricted` trait on `Map`s and `Hash`es as an easy way to restrict which keys are going to be allowed in the `Map` / `Hash`.

If you do not specify any keys with `is restricted`, it will limit to the keys that were specified when the `Map` / `Hash` was initialized.

If you **do** specify keys, then those will be the keys that will be allowed.
